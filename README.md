# Food-is-cool-in-reactJS

This is a MVP of a Food Truck app, that will allow the customers to be able to find locations of food trucks.
The truck user can create profile, menu and update time and location.
The customer can login and view map to find food trucks and like their favorite food trucks.


This is a finale project for a class I was taking.
